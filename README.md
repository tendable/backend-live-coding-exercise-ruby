# Perfect Ward Coding Assessment

## Usage
`bundle`
`bundle exec questionnaire.rb`

## Goal
Construct a command line program that can ask a series of Yes/No questions. The answers will need to be persisted so they can be used in calculations for subsequent runs. 

After storing the answers the program should calculate and print a rating. The calculation for the rating is: `100 * number of yes answers / number of questions`. The program should also print an average rating for all runs.
